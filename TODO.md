Tasks
=====

## Current

* Add documentation to README.md.
* Investigate / implement server-side rendering.
* Make sure tests pass.
* Implement / switch LS/no-server-side for `gh-pages` vs normal.
* Webpack: New uglify options form.
* Gulp: Switch to jsxhint.
* Remove `app-OLD-DELETE`


## Notes

* Maybe use an integration library:
    * https://github.com/jhudson8/react-backbone
    * https://github.com/clayallsopp/react.backbone
    * https://github.com/magalhas/backbone-react-component

## Issues

* React Components need to be imported to work, but with JsHint ignoring
  JSX stuff, you can't tell from unused stuff.
